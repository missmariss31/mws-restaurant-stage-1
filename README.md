# Restaurant Reviews App

This app is the final project for the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.  Starting out with a non-responsive website, I added responsive elements to the project, along with implementing a Service Worker for offline access to the Restaurant Reviews App.

To interact with the Restaurant Reviews App, follow the steps below.

1.  Clone the repository - 'git clone https://github.com/missmariss31/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git'
2.  Open repository in terminal - 'cd mws-restaurant-stage-1'
3.  In the directory, run a local server - 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer'
4.  In your browser, go to your local server - 'localhost:8000'
